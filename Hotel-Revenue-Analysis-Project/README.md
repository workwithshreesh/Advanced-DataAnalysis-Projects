## Background
This project explores a hotel revenue dataset spanning across three years (2018, 2019, and 2020). SQL and Power BI were leveraged to uncover valuable insights about revenue & guest seasonality.

Data from raw .csv file was ingested into **SQL Server Management Studio [SSMS]**, from which SQL queries were iteratively built upon to obtain the final SQL output which was then imported into SSMS for data analysis & visualization. Additional data processing was done in **PowerBI** with **PowerQuery M** for visualization purposes. Guests, revenue seasonality, recommendation for staffing arrangement, and dataset limitations were explained in the accompanying **PowerPoint slide** with the help of PowerBI visualizations.

### The project addresses the following key business questions:

**1. Which are the busiest months? On average, how long do guests stay at the hotel?**

![Answer 1](data/image/1.png)

**2. Which day of the week do different types of guests, typically like to book on?**

**4. What is the revenue breakdown by region? What are the top 5 countries that has generated the greatest revenue?**
